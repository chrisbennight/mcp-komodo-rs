# Where crates come from. This stage reaches the network, and the fleet wants
# that traffic through its caching proxy - but Docker gives a RUN step an
# environment built from this file rather than the caller's, so the address has
# to arrive as a build argument.
#
# Cargo reads no environment variable for a mirror, so unlike pip or npm it
# cannot simply be told: the redirect has to be a config file, written from this
# value below. The name stays outside cargo's own CARGO_ namespace on purpose -
# cargo maps CARGO_REGISTRY_INDEX onto its removed registry.index key and aborts
# every invocation, and an ARG is visible to RUN as an environment variable, so
# that spelling would break the build it was meant to route.
#
# Left unsupplied it stays unset, no config file is written, and cargo resolves
# from crates.io. That fallback is what keeps this image buildable away from the
# network the proxy lives on.

# goes on naming crates-io and a lock produced here still resolves from the
# public index.
#
# Appended rather than written, so whatever else .cargo/config.toml carries is
# preserved. The repository's copy deliberately no longer pins a source: a
# committed mirror address would be a hard dependency on a host that resolves
# only on the LAN, which is exactly what this argument exists to avoid.
